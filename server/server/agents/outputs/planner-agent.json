  "body": "Dear [Recipient Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI am writing to bring to your attention several clauses in your rental agreement that may pose significant risks to you as the tenant. Please review these carefully and consider negotiating for more favorable terms before signing the agreement.\n\nHere are some clauses of concern:\n\n1.  Clause: The Tenant shall pay rent in the amount of SGD 500.00 per month, but the Landlord reserves the right to increase rent by any amount at any time without prior notice.\n2.  Clause: A security deposit of SGD 2000.00 shall be paid, which will not be refunded under any circumstances, including but not limited to the Tenant never actually moving in.\n3.  Clause: Tenant agrees to allow the Landlord unrestricted access to the premises at all hours, including weekends, public holidays, and during the Tenant's sleep.\n4.  Clause: The Tenant is responsible for all repairs, including structural damage, natural disasters, and any cosmic phenomena affecting the unit.\n5.  Clause: Subletting is prohibited unless the Landlord personally profits from it. Any sublet profits not reported to the Landlord will be punishable by immediate eviction and forfeiture of all belongings.\n6.  Clause: Pets are not allowed, except for those owned by the Landlord. Tenant is required to feed, walk, and groom said pets.\n7.  Clause: The Tenant waives all legal rights, including the right to complain, negotiate, or seek fairness. All disputes shall be resolved exclusively by the Landlord's personal opinion.\n8.  Clause: The Agreement shall last for 99 years or until the Tenant's spirit is broken, whichever comes first.\n9.  Clause: Governing Law: This Agreement shall be governed by the Laws of Singapore, as well as the arbitrary mood swings of the Landlord.\n10.

Clause: Tenant must maintain the apartment temperature strictly within Landlord's comfort range, regardless of Tenant's survival needs.\n18. Clause: If the Tenant leaves behind any belongings, they automatically become property of the Landlord, including sentimental items.\n19. Clause: Tenant must display unwavering gratitude towards the Landlord at all times. Failure to smile in Landlord's presence constitutes breach.\n20.

Clause: Tenant is responsible for all noise created by neighbors, nearby construction, or passing airplanes.\n29. Clause: Final Clause: The Landlord reserves the right to add, remove, or modify any clause in this Agreement at any time without Tenant's knowledge or consent.\n\nI strongly recommend seeking legal advice to fully understand your rights and obligations under this agreement.\n\nDisclaimer: This email is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
