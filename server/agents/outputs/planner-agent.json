  "body": "Dear Recipient,\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI am writing to bring to your attention several clauses in your rental agreement that may be considered high-risk. It is important to understand these clauses and their potential implications before signing the agreement.\n\nHere is a summary of the problematic clauses and my recommendations:\n\n1.  Clause: The Tenant shall pay rent in the amount of SGD 500.00 per month, but the Landlord reserves the right to increase rent by any amount at any time without prior notice.\nRecommendation: Negotiate for a reasonable rent increase clause.\n\n2.  Clause: A security deposit of SGD 2000.00 shall be paid, which will not be refunded under any circumstances, including but not limited to the Tenant never actually moving in.\nRecommendation: Negotiate to reduce deposit to 2 months maximum and ensure refund terms.\n\n3.  Clause: Tenant agrees to allow the Landlord unrestricted access to the premises at all hours, including weekends, public holidays, and during the Tenant's sleep.\nRecommendation: Ensure entry notice clause is present and reasonable.\n\n4.  Clause: The Tenant waives all legal rights, including the right to complain, negotiate, or seek fairness. All disputes shall be resolved exclusively by the Landlord's personal opinion.\nRecommendation: This clause is illegal and should be removed.\n\n5.  Clause: The Agreement shall last for 99 years or until the Tenant's spirit is broken, whichever comes first.\nRecommendation: Ensure tenancy period meets minimum legal requirements.\n\n6.  Clause: Governing Law: This Agreement shall be governed by the Laws of Singapore, as well as the arbitrary mood swings of the Landlord.\nRecommendation: This is not a valid governing law clause and should be removed.\n\n7.

Clause: Tenant must perform weekly entertainment (karaoke, interpretive dance, or comedy routines) for the Landlord without compensation.\nRecommendation: This clause is unreasonable and should be removed.\n\n9.
