  "body": "Dear [Recipient Name],\n\nI am writing to you today to express my concerns about some clauses in the rental agreement you provided. These clauses appear to be high-risk and could potentially lead to unfair or unfavorable situations for you as the tenant. I strongly recommend seeking legal advice before signing the agreement.\n\nHere are some of the clauses that raise significant concerns:\n\n1.  Clause: The Tenant shall pay rent in the amount of SGD 500.00 per month, but the Landlord reserves the right to increase rent by any amount at any time without prior notice.\nRecommendation: Negotiate for a reasonable rent increase clause with prior notice.\n\n2.  Clause: A security deposit of SGD 2000.00 shall be paid, which will not be refunded under any circumstances, including but not limited to the Tenant never actually moving in.\nRecommendation: Negotiate to reduce deposit to 2 months maximum and ensure refund conditions are fair.\n\n3.  Clause: Tenant agrees to allow the Landlord unrestricted access to the premises at all hours, including weekends, public holidays, and during the Tenant's sleep.\nRecommendation: Ensure entry notice clause is present and reasonable (e.g., 24 hours notice).\n\n4.  Clause: The Tenant is responsible for all repairs, including structural damage, natural disasters, and any cosmic phenomena affecting the unit.\nRecommendation: Negotiate a reasonable cap for minor repairs and exclude structural damage and natural disasters.\n\n5.

Any sublet profits not reported to the Landlord will be punishable by immediate eviction and forfeiture of all belongings.\nRecommendation: Confirm subletting terms are clear and fair.\n\n6. Clause: Pets are not allowed, except for those owned by the Landlord. Tenant is required to feed, walk, and groom said pets.\nRecommendation: Remove the clause.\n\n7. Clause: The Tenant waives all legal rights, including the right to complain, negotiate, or seek fairness. All disputes shall be resolved exclusively by the Landlord's personal opinion.\nRecommendation: Remove the clause.\n\n8. Clause: The Agreement shall last for 99 years or until the Tenant's spirit is broken, whichever comes first.\nRecommendation: Negotiate for a standard tenancy period (e.g., 1-2 years).\n\n9. Clause: Governing Law: This Agreement shall be governed by the Laws of Singapore, as well as the arbitrary mood swings of the Landlord.\nRecommendation: Remove the part about the arbitrary mood swings of the Landlord.\n\n10. Clause: Late payment of rent shall incur a penalty equal to the GDP of a small nation, payable immediately.\nRecommendation: Negotiate for a reasonable late payment penalty.\n\n11. Clause: Tenant must perform weekly entertainment (karaoke, interpretive dance, or comedy routines) for the Landlord without compensation.\nRecommendation: Remove the clause.\n\n12. Clause: Any noise complaints made by the Tenant will be considered a violation of this Agreement and grounds for eviction.\nRecommendation: Remove the clause.\n\n13. Clause: The Landlord reserves the right to use Tenant's room for storage of personal items, livestock, or experimental technology.\nRecommendation: Remove the clause.\n\n14. Clause: Tenant shall provide free labor for all landlord's projects, including but not limited to gardening, laundry, and emotional support.\nRecommendation: Remove the clause.\n\n15. Clause: The Tenant must ask permission before breathing loudly within the unit.\nRecommendation: Remove the clause.\n\n16.

Clause: Tenant must maintain the apartment temperature strictly within Landlord's comfort range, regardless of Tenant's survival needs.\nRecommendation: Remove the clause.\n\n18. Clause: If the Tenant leaves behind any belongings, they automatically become property of the Landlord, including sentimental items.\nRecommendation: Negotiate for a reasonable process for handling abandoned belongings.\n\n19. Clause: Tenant must display unwavering gratitude towards the Landlord at all times. Failure to smile in Landlord's presence constitutes breach.\nRecommendation: Remove the clause.\n\n20. Clause: Renovations or improvements carried out by Tenant become permanent gifts to the Landlord, who takes full credit for them.\nRecommendation: Negotiate that any improvements made by tenant are recognized.\n\n21. Clause: The Tenant may not question the fairness of any clause in this Agreement, verbally or in writing.\nRecommendation: Remove the clause.\n\n22. Clause: Tenant shall not look directly at the Landlord's personal possessions without prior written consent.\nRecommendation: Remove the clause.\n\n23.

Clause: The Tenant must water the Landlord's plants and apologize if they wilt, regardless of fault.\nRecommendation: Remove the clause.\n\n28. Clause: Tenant is responsible for all noise created by neighbors, nearby construction, or passing airplanes.\nRecommendation: Remove the clause.\n\n29. Final Clause: The Landlord reserves the right to add, remove, or modify any clause in this Agreement at any time without Tenant's knowledge or consent.\nRecommendation: Remove the clause.\n\nI urge you to carefully review each clause and seek clarification or negotiation where necessary. It's important to protect your rights and interests as a tenant.\n\nDisclaimer: This is for informational purposes only.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]",
