        <h2>Review of Your Rental Agreement</h2>
        <div>Dear Recipient,<br/><br/>I hope this email finds you well.<br/><br/>I am writing to bring to your attention several clauses in your rental agreement that may be considered high-risk. It is important to understand these clauses and their potential implications before signing the agreement.<br/><br/>Here is a summary of the problematic clauses and my recommendations:<br/><br/>1.  Clause: The Tenant shall pay rent in the amount of SGD 500.00 per month, but the Landlord reserves the right to increase rent by any amount at any time without prior notice.<br/>Recommendation: Negotiate for a reasonable rent increase clause.<br/><br/>2.  Clause: A security deposit of SGD 2000.00 shall be paid, which will not be refunded under any circumstances, including but not limited to the Tenant never actually moving in.<br/>Recommendation: Negotiate to reduce deposit to 2 months maximum and ensure refund terms.<br/><br/>3.  Clause: Tenant agrees to allow the Landlord unrestricted access to the premises at all hours, including weekends, public holidays, and during the Tenant's sleep.<br/>Recommendation: Ensure entry notice clause is present and reasonable.<br/><br/>4.
